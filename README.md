## Feature Selecting using Bat Algorithm 

This repository contains an implementation of the Bat Algorithm, a metaheuristic optimization technique inspired by the echolocation behavior of bats. The algorithm has been specifically adapted for feature selection tasks in machine learning to identify the most relevant features from a dataset, improving model accuracy and reducing computational complexity.

## Features

- Implements the standard Bat Algorithm for feature selection.
- Compatible with common machine learning datasets and frameworks.
- Easy-to-use Python implementation with customization options
- Supports visualization of feature selection results

## Applications

The Bat Algorithm for feature selection can be applied to:

- Classification problems (e.g., spam detection, disease prediction).
- Regression problems.
- Dimensionality reduction for high-dimensional datasets.
  

## Customization

- **Objective Function**: Replace the default test function with your own by modifying the `objective_function` in the provided examples or the main implementation.
- **Parameter Tuning**: Experiment with the parameters to achieve better results for your specific problem.
- **Visualization**: Enhance the visualization capabilities by extending the `matplotlib` plots.
